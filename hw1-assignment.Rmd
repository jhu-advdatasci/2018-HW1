## Motivation 

Your parents retired a few years ago and they are considering 
relocating into a retirement home. Currently, their top two
choices for states to move to are Florida or California. 
While they are excited to live in some place new, they are
worried about driving in their old age considering the motor 
vehicle traffic fatalities in Florida and California.

You want to recommend to your parents which state might be 
better or maybe even recommend a different state based on 
other preferences they may have, such as access to mass 
transit, weather, hiking, etc. You did some research and found 
the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). You
[read](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)
that "FARS is a nationwide census providing NHTSA, Congress 
and the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries
suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes". You decide to 
explore the dataset and other state-level features to be 
able to recommend a state for your parents to move to. 

Some datasets that you will find useful are: 

* [2015 FARS data](ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars/2015/National/FARS2015NationalDBF.zip) and [2015 FARS user guide](http://www.nber.org/fars/ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars/FARS-DOC/Analytical%20User%20Guide/USERGUIDE-2015.pdf)
* [Geographic Locator Codes (GLCs) for the U.S. and U.S. Territories](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/geographic-locator-codes/glcs-for-the-us-and-us-territories)
* [US Census population totals by state for 2015](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/state-total.html#par_textimage)
* [Life Expectancy at Birth (in years)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy)


## Problem 1

### Problem 1.1

Read in the `accident.dbf` dataset into R from the 2015 FARS dataset and create a data frame called `acc`. 

**Hint**: You might find the 
[foreign](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/index.html)
R package useful here. 

```{r}
## add your code here

```

### Problem 1.2 

You see first colum in the `acc` dataset (`STATE`) contains 
the Geographic Locator Code (GLC) for each US state. Read 
in the GLCs dataset for the US and US territories. Create
a data frame called `states` that contains a state name
and state GLC code in each row. 

```{r}
## add your code here 

```


### Problem 1.3 

Add the state abbreviation and region to the `states`
data frame using the 
[state dataset](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/state.html) 
in R.

```{r}
## add your code here

```

### Problem 1.4

Add the state name, abbreviation and region 
to the `acc` dataset. 

```{r}
## add your code here

```

### Problem 1.5

Add a column to the `acc` dataset containing 
the 2015 population total for each state.


```{r}
## add your code here 

```



## Problem 2

Which states have the most motor vehicle fatalities? 

### Problem 2.1

Calculate the total number of fatalities by state and 
visualize the results with a barplot. The x-axis should 
be names of the states and the y-axis should be the 
total number of fatalities. Order the barplot in 
descending order with the largest number of fatalities 
on the left side and the smallest on the right side. 

```{r}
## add your code here

```

Which states contain the most fatalities? 
Which states contain the least? 

#### Add a summary of your findings here



### Problem 2.2 

If we consider the top 3 states with the most fatalities, 
are there certain times of the year which are more 
or less problematic for these states? Create a 
data visualization (plot) to explore this question
and summarize your findings. 

**Hint**: Create a plot of fatalities across time. 
Read about the `as.Date()` function.

```{r}
## add your code here

```

If there are states that have differences
across time, why do you think that is?

#### Add a summary of your findings here


## Problem 3

Based on the lectures, we learned that healthcare 
spending and coverage was highly related to total
population size. Let's explore how traffic fatalities 
are related to population size and other variables 
that might be relevant to your parents. 

### Problem 3.1

Is there a relationship between total fatality 
and population size? How does this change 
across regions and states. Create a data visualization 
(plot) to explore this question and summarize 
your results. 

**Hint**: Try coloring the states by regions and 
add the state abbreviations to the plot. 


```{r}
## add your code here

```

#### Add a summary of your findings here


### Problem 3.2 

Instead of total number of fatalities, calculate 
the fatality rate (total number of fatalities 
divided by population size). How does the 
fatality rate change across regions and states? 
Create a data visualization (plot) to explore 
these questions and summarize your results. 


```{r}
## add your code here

```

Which states have the highest fatality rate? 
Which states have the lowest fatlity rate? 

#### Add a summary of your findings here


### Problem 3.3 

Is rate of traffic fatalities related to life 
expectancy? Create a data visualization 
(plot) to explore this question and summarize 
your results. 

**Hint**: Color the states by regions and 
add the state abbreviations on top of your plot. 


```{r}
## add your code here

```

#### Add a summary of your findings here



## Problem 4 

As your parents are now retired, they have three 
additional other concerns:

1. How much a state spends on medicare
2. Living in warm weather
3. Access to several large cosmopolitan cities. 

Given what you have learned in this homework 
assignment, investigate these three additional 
concerns from your parents by looking at 
other datasets that would be useful in helping
them decide where to live. You can use 
whatever sources of data that you think best 
help make a recommendation for your parents 
on where to move to for their retirement. 

**Note:** There is no wrong answer, but to 
get full credit, a complete response to this 
quesion should include: (1) recommendations 
of states to move to, (2) additional exploratory 
data analyses investigating the three additional
concerns from your parents, and (3) a summary of
the findings from the data analyzed in the three 
previous problems and/or other datasets that you 
think are relevant given their additional three 
concerns listed above.
